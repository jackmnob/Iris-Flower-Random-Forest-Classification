# **Iris Flower Classification - Random Forest**  
  
## ***Project Overview***
*This project involves using a Random Forest model developed in Python to classify Iris flower types based on various flower attributes (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). The model is built to predict flower species and assess the performance of machine learning algorithms in real-world classification tasks.*  
  
*The final product is available on Kaggle. It is a robust and accurate classification model, with the ability to predict the species of Iris flowers for any user to enjoy.*  
  
## ***Project Workflow***
1. **Data Collection** - The Iris flower dataset was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains 150 samples, each representing one of three Iris flower species.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** - Leveraged pandas to clean the data, detect any missing values, and perform EDA prior to model implementation.
3. **Model Development** - Built a Random Forest model using Python's scikit-learn library to classify each species based on their attributes (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width).
4. **Model Evaluation** - Evaluated our model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and a confusion matrix.
5. **Visualization** - Visualized our model's performance with confusion matrices and a simple random forest tree diagram for insights into how the model makes its predictions.

## ***Interactive Model Insights***  
- Performance Metrics: Our model demonstrates high accuracy in classifying Iris flower species which provides insight into the precision and recall for each species.
- Confusion Matrix: A detailed confusion matrix was used to visualize the true vs predicted labels, helping assess model accuracy.
- Model Transparency: This Random Forest modelâ€™s behavior can be analyzed through the visualized decision tree. Generally speaking, Random Forest models are NOT known for their transparency.
